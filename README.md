Concept: "In a land void of color and diversity, only a brave few will choose to be different."

In this game you must first recruit your players (Warriors and Archers), specialize them to your liking, and battle them 
in the arena against your AI enemies. 

This is just a proof of concept and a basic introduction to java game development in general.
Inspired by "The King's League" games developed by kurechii ( http://armorgames.com/user/kurechii )
